# Coding Quiz

In this project developed a fully functional coding quiz application. I started by building the ``HTML`` and creating a clear base to build upon.I then added my ``CSS`` to design a polished an user friendly ux/ui. I then placed my ``Javascript`` into the application to bring it to life with different animations, a timer, a progress bar, and a correct and incorrect choice indicator. Bringing all this together allowed me to create this Coding Quiz.
