Module 4 Code Quiz project

In this Project I was tasked with making a fully functional coding quiz.
I started by building the html and then added my css and javascript together. This was a very fun but challenging project and it caused me to stop working a few times because of frustration but I came back and was able to finish it. I used the same color scheme through out the whole application.
